# Quest: Introductory Adventure

This short adventure is designed to help a group of new players get started . Ideally all players should have created their character before the adventure begins, although there’s nothing to say that you can’t start the session with character creation, then lead straight into the adventure – in this case, double your snack provisions, you gaming monsters!

> So, here we are, at the very beginning of the thing. Are you ready for adventure? Because, old friend ready-or-not, the  adventure is waiting, and she doesn't look like the patient sort. Gird your weapon, grab your sack and let's get going.

## Setting

The player characters are individually travelling in the Grand Caravan that anually crosses the plains of Nhetan, carrying trade goods and travelers between the 13 Kingdoms and the city of Keffi. Each player character is travelling to Keffi for their own reasons. Although, these reasons are quickly swept aside as each character is pushed in a new direction and pulled together to form an adventure party. The adventure the concludes when the party reaches an adventure hub, the mysterious city to Tzook.

## Adventure Synopis

The PCs group up when the caravan they are travelling in is attacked by bandits. One of the other passengers, a short man who introduces himself as Sir Rastus Bear asks the PCs to help him escape, as it is he the bandits are searching for. In return he promises that the PCs will each receive a thing of great value, although he cannot tell them what until they reach their destination. The scene is completed after the PCs evade the bandits, rushing into a growing duststorm. The party finds shelter from the storm and can now properly make introductions. Each player can say as much or as little as they like about their characters. Sir Rastus ends the introductions by telling the party about himself. It's at this point that the party finds out that, contrary to expectations, Sir Rastus is not heading to the city of Keffi, the caravan's destination, instead he is going to an ancient O'Jypta ruin, located on the wall of the Singing Butte. Although this location is less than a day from Keffi, it is situated in the highlands, a very dangerous place that will make for a much more "interesting" journey than Keffi.

Sir Rastus Bear is an adventurer-for-hire who hops from world to world doing good deeds, and being paid marvelously for his efforts. Currently he is on a mission for the magical city of Tzook, a mysterious place that once escaped a great calamity by teleporting into the rift, where it floats in near complete isolation from the rest of the omniverse. Portals connect the city to a number of other worlds, making Tzook an incredibly useful hub for people travelling between worlds. However, the portals don't last forever, so the rulers of Tzook need to regularly open replacement portals. Sir Rastus is on a mission to create a new portal to Tzook, using the residual magical energies stored in the ruin of an ancient O'Jypta temple. To create a portal to Tzook, Sir Rastus carries a lump of heart stone, part of the bedrock on which Tzook is situated. This rock is necessary for creating a strong magical connection between the Tzook and the portal destination, this ensures that the portal can persist for a few years. The heart stone has other uses and is extraordinarily valuable, especially to those who might wish to take control of Tzook. One such group has hired a mercenary group, called the Crimson Cadre, commanded by a ruthless warrior called Cretus Khetarn. Khetarn and is crimson-clad brutes plan to ambush and kill Sir Rastus and take his heart stone to their patrons who would create their own portal to Tzook, one the Crimson Cadre would use to invade and take control of the city.

**Episode One: Beginnings**

The players are introduced to their surroundings, a large horse drawn carriage with room for 12 passangers. Then almost immediately the caravan is attacked by warriors in red cloaks. One of the other occupants of the carriage, a stout man with black hair and beard who calls himself Sir Rastus confides to the PCs that it is he the attackers are hunting and that should he be captured and killed a great evil will befall his home. He makes an offer to the PCs, if they help him escape and get him safely to his destination he will reward them with something extremely precious - though he is forbidden by a solemn  oath from speaking of the reward until has completed his secret mission. The PCs have little to lose, it's not like they intend to stick around and get killed by the bandits, it is assumed they take up his offer.

The PCs don't have time to come up with a complicated plan, they have to think and move fast. In this situation a quickly executed bad plan may be better than a good plan that is long discussed. Hiding Sir Rastus from the bandits can buy more time, as the Bandits won't coordinate efforts to attack or capture the PCs so long as Sir Rastus is not spotted. If the attackers spot him then they will quickly muster their forces to surround him.

Some of the attacker have horses, it might be possible for some of the PCs to dismount the warriors and escape on a horse, though its unlikely that his option is available to less combat orientated characters. 

**Episode: Two: From a hard place to a rock**

The journey from the Nhetan Plains to the Keffi highlands takes three days of travel, during which the PCs face minor obstacles and learn a little more about their patron. 

**Greater Red Rock Stork** A large red bird is seen flying around. Sir Rastus fears that it is some kind of scout for the Crimson Horde. The party must make efforts to evade the bird as it flies over. 

**Chase through the valley of the chonth** The party must cross a particular stretch of valley or face an extra day of travel but the valley contains a tightly packed herd of chonth, oversized bison-like creatures that are infamous for stampeding careless passers by to death.

A precarious situation unless to party includes a naturalist or has some smart ideas. The Guide should dress the situation up as dangerous, although in truth crossing the valley only becomes life threatening if someone does something really foolish or very unlucky in a their die roll.

**Singing in the night**

With the destination visible in the distance, Sir Rastus suggests making camp so as to get better light for tackling the walk to the entrance of the ruin. He has been lead to believe that getting into the ruin requires a walk along a ledge that circles the great tower of red rock that is the Singing butte.

In the night, distant singing can be heard. The voice is very low in pitch and does not sound like it is coming from a human. The words of the song sound like a strange language that none of the party can understand. 

**Episode Three: Exploring the O'Jypta Hall Spirit Cleansing**

The party arrives at the Singing Butte, although only the sound of the wind can be heard. At the base of the Butte is a ledge that coils around the butte, leading up to a door on about five metres from the top.


## Episode One: Introductions

### Scene: Bandit attack

The Grand Caravan takes two or three days to cross the flood plains, depending on the weather and how heavy the winter rains fell. It is the morning of the second day when a column of red smoke is seen, apparently some miles ahead of the caravan.

Soon after the sighting, the mercenary riders who have been escorting the caravan all galloped away without saying a word. Both traders and travelers become anxious as the day draws to a close. Just before sunset all hell breaks loose. Soldiers, dressed in blood red uniforms, some on horse, some on foot rush to attack the caravan from two sides. The attack is swift and violent, but the attackers are clearly looking for something, or someone. They upturn carts and run through anyone who resists but they’re making no attempt to rob or kill indiscriminately. Traders and travelers run screaming in every direction. Some look for cover among nearby bushes and boulders.

## Carriage four

The PCs have been sitting together in a large horse drawn carriage (just referred to as number four), so when everything kicks off, they naturally come together, even though they have never met.
The PCs are each called by name but a small well-dressed man who they have no memory of having ever met. “I fear that these raiders are looking for me. I am carrying something vitally important. Aid me in my escape, get me safely to my destination and your kindness will be rewarded with a rare thing of great value.
