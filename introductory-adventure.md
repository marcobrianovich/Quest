# Quest: Introductory Adventure

This short adventure is designed to help a group of new players get started . Ideally all players should have created their character before the adventure begins, although there’s nothing to say that you can’t start the session with character creation, then lead straight into the adventure – in this case, double your snack provisions, you gaming monsters!

> So, here we are, at the very beginning of the thing. Are you ready for adventure? Because, old friend ready-or-not, the  adventure is waiting, and she doesn't look like the patient sort. Gird your weapon, grab your sack and let's get going.

## Setting

The player characters are individually travelling in the Grand Caravan that anually crosses the plains of Nhetan, carrying trade goods and travelers between the 13 Kingdoms and the city of Keffi. Each player character is travelling to Keffi for their own reasons. Although, these reasons are quickly swept away as each character is pushed in a new direction and pulled together to form an adventure party. The adventure the concludes when the party reaches an adventure hub, the mysterious city to Tzook.

## Adventure Synopis

The PCs group together when the caravan they're each travelling with is attacked by bandits. One of the other passengers, a small man who introduces himself as Sir Rastus Bear asks the PCs to help him escape, as it is he that the bandits are searching for. In return the PCs will receive a thing of great value, although he cannot tell them what until they reach their destination. The scene is completed after the PCs evade the bandits, rushing into a growing duststorm. The party finds shelter from the storm and can now properly make introductions. Each player can say as much or as little as they like about their characters. Sir Rastus ends the introductions by telling the party about himself. It's at this point that the party finds out that, contrary to expectations, Sir Rastus is not heading to the city of Keffi, the destination of the caravan in which they were all travelling, he is going to an ancient O'Jypta ruin, located on the wall of the Singing Butte. Although this location is less than a day from Keffi, it is located in the highlands Getting to there will be a great deal more "interesting" than continuing on to Keffi.

Sir Rastus Bear is an adventurer-for-hire who hops from world to world doing good deeds, and being paid marvelously for his efforts. Currently he is on a mission for the magical city of Tzook, a mysterious place that once escaped a great calamity by teleporting into the rift, where it floats in near complete isolation from the rest of the omniverse. Portals connect the city to a number of other worlds, making Tzook an incredibly useful hub for people travelling between worlds. However, the portals don't last forever, so the rulers of Tzook need to regularly open replacement portals up. Sir Rastus is on a mission to create a new portal to Tzook, using the residual magical energies stored in the ruin of an ancient O'Jypta temple. To create a portal to Tzook, Sir Rastus carries a lump of heart stone, part of the bedrock on which Tzook is situated. This rock is necessary for creating a strong magical connection between the Tzook and the portal destination that ensures the portal can persist for a year or more. The heart stone has other uses and is extraordinarily valuable, especially to those who might wish to take control of Tzook. One such group has hired a mercenary group, called the Crimson Cadre, commanded by a ruthless warrior called Cretus Khetarn. Khetarn and is crimson-clad brutes plan to ambush and kill Sir Rastus and take his heart stone to their patrons.



## Episode One: Introductions

### Scene: Bandit attack

The Grand Caravan takes two or three days to cross the flood plains, depending on the weather and how heavy the winter rains fell. It is the morning of the second day when a column of black smoke is seen, apparently some miles ahead of the caravan.

Soon after the sighting, the mercenary riders who have been escorting the caravan all galloped away without saying a word. Both traders and travelers become anxious as the day draws to a close. Just before sunset all hell breaks loose. Soldiers, dressed in blood red uniforms, some on horse, some on foot rush to attack the caravan from two sides. The attack is swift and violent, but the attackers are clearly looking for something, or someone. They upturn carts and run through anyone who resists but they’re making no attempt to rob or kill indiscriminately. Traders and travelers run screaming in every direction. Some look for cover among nearby bushes and boulders.

## Carriage four

The PCs have been sitting together in a large horse drawn carriage (just referred to as number four), so when everything kicks off, they naturally come together, even though they have never met.
The PCs are each called by name but a small well-dressed man who they have no memory of having ever met. “I fear that these raiders are looking for me. I am carrying something vitally important. Aid me in my escape, get me safely to my destination and your kindness will be rewarded with a rare thing of great value.
