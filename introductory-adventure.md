# Quest: Introductory Adventure


This is a short adventure that is designed to help a group of new players get started. Ideally all players should have created their character before the adventure begins, although there’s nothing to say that you can’t start the session with character building, then lead straight into the adventure – in this case, double your snack provisions, you gaming monsters!


> So, here we are, at the very beginning of the thing. Are you ready for adventure? Because, old friend ready-or-not, the  adventure is waiting, and she doesn't look like the patient sort. Gird your weapon, grab your sack and let's get going.

## Setting

The player characters are individually travelling in the Grand Caravan that once-a-year crosses the flood plains of Nhetan, carrying trade goods and travelers between the 13 Kingdoms and the city of Keffi. Each player character is travelling to Keffi for their own reasons. 

## Adventure Synopis

The PCs group together when the caravan they're each travelling with is attacked by bandits. One of the other passengers, a small man called Sir Rastus Bear approaches the PCs and asked them to help him escape, as it is he that the bandits are searching for. In return the PCs will receive a thing of great value, although he cannot tell them what until they reach their destination. The scene is completed after the PCs evade the bandits, rushing into a growing sandstorm. The party finds shelter from the storm and can now properly make introductions. Each player can say as much or as little as they like about their characters. Rir Rastus ends the introductions by telling the party about himself.

## Episode One: Introductions

The Grand Caravan takes two or three days to cross the flood plains, depending on the weather and how heavy the winter rains fell. It is the morning of the second day when a column of black smoke is seen, apparently some miles ahead of the caravan.

Soon after the sighting, the mercenary riders who have been escorting the caravan all galloped away without saying a word. Both traders and travelers become anxious as the day draws to a close. Just before sunset all hell breaks loose. Soldiers, dressed in blood red uniforms, some on horse, some on foot rush to attack the caravan from two sides. The attack is swift and violent, but the attackers are clearly looking for something, or someone. They upturn carts and run through anyone who resists but they’re making no attempt to rob or kill indiscriminately. Traders and travelers run screaming in every direction. Some look for cover among nearby bushes and boulders. 

## Carriage Four

The PCs have been sitting together in a large horse drawn carriage (just referred to as number four), so when everything kicks off, they naturally come together, even though they have never met.
The PCs are each called by name but a small well-dressed man who they have no memory of having ever met. “I fear that these raiders are looking for me. I am carrying something vitally important. Aid me in my escape, get me safely to my destination and your kindness will be rewarded with a rare thing of great value.
